## East side
- Pergola and deck attached Sitting room
This feature can be optional and leave as future build for budget reason.

## West side
the narrow side

- some green leaf on the fence
Because we can see through from kitchen and pantry glass. We wanna some low maintain plants there. Ground surface prefer sealed by concrete.

## Frontyard
- Prefer a flat lawn block with ret wall at each end. It would be nice to have a big flat terrace on front yard.

- Existing plants in frontyard slope are still nice but need to mulch, trim and cleanup. Photo taken at year 2015 when we first bought the property

- The Metricon Hampshire lodge facade
This is the facade we chosen, a contemporary and lodge feel facade, which we think harmonized to the surrounding leafy street feel

- Front yerd stair cases.
Prefer stair cases from the boundry lot. If for the budget reason, stair could start from the end of driveway.
