Neighbour at rear of the lot asking for her privacy. If we removed the existing tree at rear of the lot, we could put some dense hedge, for example:

## East side
- Pergola and deck attached Sitting room.

The pergola and desk feature can be optional and leave as future build for budget reason.

## West side
the narrow side
- some green leaf on the fence
Because we can see through from kitchen and pantry glass. We wanna some low maintain plants there. Ground surface prefer sealed by concrete.

## Frontyard
- Prefer a flat lawn block with ret wall at each end. It would be nice to have a big flat terrace on front yard.

- Existing plants in frontyard slope are still nice but need to mulch, trim and cleanup. Photo taken at year 2015 when we first bought the property

- The Metricon Hampshire lodge facade
This is the facade we chosen, a contemporary and lodge feel facade, which we think harmonized to the surrounding leafy street feel.

Our facade cladding board and garage door color are called Caoba(another name maybe Cabots Rich Walnut?) color.

- Front yerd stair cases.
Prefer stair cases from the boundry lot. If for the budget reason, stair could start from the end of driveway.
