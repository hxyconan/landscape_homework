# Landscape Homework

This document is created for Lone Pine Landscapes for showing what we like. Lone Pine can refer to those inspiration images for design ideas. We took photos from open inspections in upper north shore or googled. 

Please use this document for reference only. Landscape designer should feel free to input any ideas based on his own experiences and professionals..


## Backyard
- infinite pool and lawn area with few steps up. 

- retention walls we like.

- Dense hedge



## Left side ()
- Pergola and deck next to Sitting room



## Right side (the narrow side)
- need some green leaf on the fence


## Frontyard


- Prefer a flat lawn block with ret wall at each end. 
- Existing plants in frontyard slope are still nice but need to mulch & trim & cleanup.
