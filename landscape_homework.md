####  Dense hedge
Neighbour at rear of the lot needs her privacy. If we removed the existing tree at rear of the lot, we could put some dense hedge, for example:

## East side <a name="East-side"></a>
East side has lots sun in the morning and afternoon before 2pm.

####  Pergola and deck attached Sitting room.
The pergola and desk feature can be optional and leave as future build for budget reason.

## West side <a name="West-side"></a>

the narrow side

#### some green leaf on the fence
Because we can see through from kitchen and pantry glass. We wanna some low maintain plants there. Ground surface prefer to be sealed by concrete.

## Frontyard <a name="Frontyard"></a>

#### Prefer a flat lawn block with ret wall at each end. It would be nice to have a big flat terrace in front yard.

####  Existing plants in frontyard slope are still nice but need to mulch, trim and cleanup. Photo taken at year 2015 when we first bought the property

#### The Metricon Hampshire lodge facade
This is the facade we chosen, a contemporary and lodge feel facade, which we think harmonized to the surrounding leafy street feel.

#### Our facade cladding board and garage door color are called Caoba(another name maybe Cabots Rich Walnut?) color.

#### Front yard stair cases.
Prefer stair cases from the lot boundry. But if for the budget reason, stair could start from the end of driveway.

#### Front yard small fountains and water pond feature also nice if easy to build

#### Electric gate also nice, but most likely will be future build option
